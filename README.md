- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Macoara,
- Who are you?
  I am Marisol CortÃ©s, a software development enthusiast who has decided to change careers from risk prevention engineering to web development.
  Where are you from?
  I am originally from Chile, from the city of La Serena, although I have traveled quite a bit in the last few years since 2001 when I decided
  to settle in the town of Iquique. Then I returned to central Chile to the ValparaÃ­so region for work I am currently in Calama and,
  I plan to travel to New Zealand to study English.
- What do you do?
  At present, I am a risk prevention engineer, but I am changing careers to dedicate myself to software and web development.
- What is your training?
  I entered the world of software development through a boot camp. In addition, in 1991 I studied publicity graphic design.
- What are your previous experiences? Why should they contact you if you have no prior experience?
  Although my experience in software development is recent, I have shown a strong interest and dedication to learning and improving my skills.
  My training in a boot camp and my motivation to change careers show my commitment and passion for web development.
  In addition, my background in risk prevention engineering and advertising graphic design provides me with a unique perspective and analytical
  and creative skills that are valuable in software development.
